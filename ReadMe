What is Javascript?


Strings
* Strings in JavaScript are primitive data types and immutable, used for displaying and working with text.
* They are fundamental concepts in programming and can be created and viewed using single quotes, double quotes, or backticks.
* Strings using double quotes and single quotes are the same, but there is no official preference.
* Template literals use backticks and work similarly to regular strings.
* To view the output, print it to the console or send an alert popup to the browser. 
* Concatenating strings, storing strings in variables, and using quotes, apostrophes, and newlines within strings are also important.

Arrays
* Array is a special data structure designed for storing ordered collections, as objects are not suitable for such situations.

Functions
A function is a group of reusable code that can be called anywhere in a program, reducing the need for repetitive code. 
* JavaScript supports modular code writing using functions, allowing programmers to divide large programs into manageable ones. 
* To write your own functions in JavaScript, define them using the function keyword, unique function name, parameter list, and statement block surrounded by curly braces.

Boolens
A Boolean is a value that represents try or false.
* They are used to evaluate certain circumstances.
* Boolens are also used in of statements. 
* With the if statement logical order is important.
